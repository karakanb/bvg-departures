# HF Departures
This is a super simple website that shows the bus and tram departures from the `Mollstr./Prenzlauer Allee` station, which is the group of bus and tram stations next to the Hellofresh Berlin office. This page is basically supposed to be a helper when leaving work to catch a train or something. It retrieves BVG data from the [derhuerst/bvg-rest](https://github.com/derhuerst/bvg-rest) project.
