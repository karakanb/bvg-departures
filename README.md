# BVG Departures
This is a super simple website that shows the bus, tram and U-Bahn departures from given stations. This page is basically supposed to be a helper when leaving work to catch a train or something. It retrieves BVG data using a custom of the [derhuerst/bvg-rest](https://github.com/derhuerst/bvg-rest) project.
